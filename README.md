<h1> PacMan </h1>


## Description:
  This is learning exercise - Pacman game I built while learning HTML, CSS an JavaScript. In addition to reqired features I added functionality : removing packman one by one and showing waringns about border cases (Add Pacman to start the game, All pacmans deleted).

## How to Run: 
  Copy the project on local machine and use IDE of your choise that incudes a web server. Deploy the index.html. Click Add Pacman buttot, then Start the Game. To remove Pacman one by one use Delete button.

## Roadmap for future improvement:
  I'm planning implement a velocity control UI that gives user abilility so spped up or slow down packmen.
